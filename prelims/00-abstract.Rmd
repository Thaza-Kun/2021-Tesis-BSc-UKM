String theory is one of several candidates for a quantum theory of gravity. The study of quantum gravity lies at the boundary of the currently known quantum mechanics. If string theory is a good theory of quantum gravity, it must be able to derive known phenomena and principles in quantum mechanics. One of these is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle which is an important pillar of quantum mechanics. This thesis will show the derivation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle from two methods: a non-local method and a local one. Both of these make use of the Nambu--Goto action which is an elementary equation in string theory. Thus, this thesis will derive equations of a string from first principle and minimal assumptions. Two of which is that these equations obey the orthonormality condition and that they obey characteristics of Hilbert space. Furthermore, this thesis will explore the possibility of a generalized uncertainty principle which emerges from multiple theories of quantum gravity. The generalized uncertainty principle imposes a minimum uncertainty in position which implies the existence of a minimum observable length in physics. Such assumption does not exist in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In string theory, the minimum length were expected due to the string length, $\ell_s$. A string cannot interact with things smaller than $\ell_s$ and therefore the generalized uncertainty principle is expected to emerge in string theory. However, it seems that nobody has been able to derive the generalized uncertainty principle from first principle in string theory. It is suggested that a new action is to be constructed with a quadratic momentum term so that the generalized uncertainty principle can be obtained.
